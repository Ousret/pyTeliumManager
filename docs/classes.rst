        This object is meant to be translated into a bytes sequence and transferred to your terminal.

    .. method:: encode()

        :return: Raw string array with payment information
        :rtype: str
        :exception SequenceDoesNotMatchLengthException:
            Will be raised if the string sequence doesn't match required length. Check your instance params.

        Translate object into a string sequence ready to be sent to device.

        :param bytes data: Raw bytes sequence to be converted into TeliumAsk instance.
        :return: Create a new TeliumAsk.
        :rtype: TeliumAsk
        :exception LrcChecksumException:

        :exception SequenceDoesNotMatchLengthException:
            Will be raised if the string sequence doesn't match required length.

        Create a new instance of TeliumAsk from a bytes sequence previously generated with encode().
        This is no use in a production environment.

Transaction results
-------------------

.. class:: TeliumResponse

    .. method:: __init__(pos_number, transaction_result, amount, payment_mode, report, currency_numeric, private)

        :param str pos_number:
            Checkout unique identifier from '01' to '99'.
        :param int transaction_result:
            Transaction result.
        :param float amount:
            Payment authorized/acquired amount.
        :param str payment_mode:
            Type of payment support.
        :param str report:
            Contains payment source unique identifier like credit-card numbers when fullsized report is enabled.
        :param str currency_numeric:
            Currency ISO format.
        :param str private:
            If supported by your device, contains transaction unique identifier.

    .. attribute:: has_succeeded

        :getter: True if transaction has been authorized, False otherwise.
        :type: bool

    .. attribute:: report

        :getter: Contain data like the card numbers for instance. Should be handled wisely.
        :type: str

    .. attribute:: transaction_id

        :getter: If supported by your device, contains transaction unique identifier.
        :type: bool

Device management
-----------------

.. class:: Telium

    .. method:: __init__(path='/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate=9600, timeout=1)

        :param path:
            Device path.

        :param int baudrate:
            Baud rate such as 9600 or 115200 etc.
            Constructor do recommend to set it as 9600.

        :param float timeout:
            Set a read timeout value.

        The port is immediately opened on object creation.

        *path* is the device path: depending on operating system. e.g.
        ``/dev/ttyACM0`` on GNU/Linux or ``COM3`` on Windows. Please be aware
        that a proper driver is needed on Windows in order to create an emulated serial device.

        Possible values for the parameter *timeout* which controls the behavior
        of the device instance:

        - ``timeout = None``:  wait forever / until requested number of bytes
          are received, not recommended.
        - ``timeout = 0``:     non-blocking mode, return immediately in any case,
          returning zero or more, up to the requested number of bytes, use it only when your computer is really fast unless
          you don't care about reliability.
        - ``timeout = x``:     set timeout to ``x`` seconds (float allowed)
          returns immediately when the requested number of bytes are available,
          otherwise wait until the timeout expires and return all bytes that
          were received until then.

    .. staticmethod:: get()

        :return: Fresh new Telium instance or None
        :rtype: Telium|None

        Auto-create a new instance of Telium. The device path will be inferred based on most common location.
        This won't be reliable if you have more than one emulated serial device plugged-in. Does not work on NT platform.

    .. method:: ask(telium_ask)

        :param TeliumAsk telium_ask: Payment details
        :return: True if device has accepted it, False otherwise.
        :rtype: bool

        Initialize payment to terminal

    .. method:: verify(telium_ask)

        :param TeliumAsk telium_ask: Payment details previously used on ask()
        :return: Transaction results as TeliumResponse, None if nothing was caught from device.
        :rtype: TeliumResponse|None

        Wait for answer and convert it to TeliumResponse.

    .. method:: close()

        :return: True if device was previously opened and now closed. False otherwise.
        :rtype: bool

        Close device if currently opened. Recommended practice, don't let Python close it from garbage collector.

    .. attribute:: timeout

        :getter: Current timeout set on read.
        :type: float
